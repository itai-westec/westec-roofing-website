      <p>Your roof is the most critical line of defense between your home and the elements. In Los Angeles, where UV exposure is relentless, Santa Ana winds drive debris into every gap, and sudden winter storms can dump inches of rain in hours, roofing materials take a beating that homeowners in milder climates never experience. The challenge is that most roof damage develops gradually &mdash; by the time you notice a leak inside your home, the underlying problem may have been building for months or even years.</p>

      <p>Here are the warning signs that indicate your roof may need replacement &mdash; and what to do about each one.</p>

      <h2>1. Your Roof is 20+ Years Old</h2>

      <p>Most <a href="../residential.html">residential roofing systems</a> in Los Angeles have a finite lifespan. Architectural shingles typically last 20 to 30 years. Clay and concrete tile can last 40 to 50 years with proper maintenance, but the underlayment beneath them often fails at the 25-year mark. Even standing seam metal, one of the longest-lasting options, will eventually show signs of wear at fastener points and seams.</p>

      <p>If your roof is approaching or has passed the 20-year mark and you haven&rsquo;t had a professional inspection recently, it&rsquo;s time. Age alone doesn&rsquo;t mean replacement is imminent, but it does mean the clock is ticking and early detection of problems saves money.</p>

      <h2>2. Missing, Cracked, or Curling Shingles</h2>

      <p>Walk outside and look at your roof from the street. If you see shingles that are curling at the edges, cracking down the middle, or missing entirely, the protective barrier is compromised. In neighborhoods like <a href="../areas/sherman-oaks.html">Sherman Oaks</a> and <a href="../areas/encino.html">Encino</a>, the San Fernando Valley heat accelerates shingle deterioration &mdash; temperatures on a south-facing roof can reach over 150&deg;F in summer, causing asphalt shingles to dry out, become brittle, and eventually fail.</p>

      <p>A few missing shingles from a single storm event can often be repaired. But if shingle damage is widespread across the roof, patching individual spots becomes a losing battle. Replacement is the smarter investment.</p>

      <h2>3. Granules in Your Gutters</h2>

      <p>Asphalt shingles are coated with small mineral granules that protect the underlying material from UV rays. When those granules start shedding &mdash; you&rsquo;ll see them accumulating in gutters, at the base of downspouts, and on the ground below your roofline &mdash; it means the shingles are losing their protective layer. Once enough granules are gone, the exposed asphalt dries out rapidly and leaks soon follow.</p>

      <p>Some granule loss is normal in the first year after installation. But heavy granule shedding on a roof that&rsquo;s several years old is a clear signal of advancing deterioration.</p>

      <h2>4. Sagging or Uneven Roof Deck</h2>

      <p>A sagging roofline is one of the most serious warning signs. It typically indicates structural damage &mdash; either the decking (plywood sheathing beneath the roofing material) has absorbed moisture and begun to rot, or the rafters or trusses supporting the roof have weakened. This is especially common on older homes in hillside neighborhoods like <a href="../areas/hollywood-hills.html">Hollywood Hills</a> and <a href="../areas/bel-air.html">Bel Air</a> where steep slopes and complex roof geometries create more opportunities for water infiltration.</p>

      <p>If you notice any dip, sag, or waviness in your roofline, call a <a href="../contact.html">roofing professional immediately</a>. This is not a cosmetic issue &mdash; it&rsquo;s a structural one that gets worse and more expensive the longer it&rsquo;s ignored.</p>

      <h2>5. Daylight Through the Roof Boards</h2>

      <p>Go into your attic on a sunny day, turn off the lights, and look up. If you can see pinpoints of daylight coming through the roof deck, water can get through those same openings. Small gaps might seem harmless, but during a heavy rain, even tiny penetrations can let in enough water to soak insulation, damage ceilings, and promote mold growth in spaces you rarely inspect.</p>

      <p>While you&rsquo;re in the attic, also look for dark stains or streaks on the underside of the roof sheathing. These are evidence of past or ongoing water intrusion even if you can&rsquo;t see daylight.</p>

      <h2>6. Water Stains on Interior Ceilings or Walls</h2>

      <p>Brown or yellowish water stains on ceilings and walls are often the first sign homeowners notice &mdash; but by this point, the leak has usually been active for a while. Water can travel along rafters and sheathing before dripping down to a visible surface, so the stain location may not be directly below the actual roof penetration.</p>

      <p>If you spot water stains, don&rsquo;t just repaint over them. Have a professional trace the leak back to its source. Sometimes a targeted repair solves the problem. But if the leak stems from widespread underlayment failure or multiple deteriorated areas, <a href="../residential.html">full roof replacement</a> is the practical long-term solution.</p>

      <h2>7. Moss, Algae, or Mold Growth</h2>

      <p>Moss and algae on a roof aren&rsquo;t just cosmetic problems. Moss holds moisture against the roofing surface, accelerating deterioration of shingles and tile underlayment. In the coastal neighborhoods of <a href="../areas/santa-monica.html">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="../areas/venice.html">Venice</a>, and <a href="../areas/manhattan-beach.html">Manhattan Beach</a>, marine layer moisture creates ideal conditions for biological growth on north-facing roof planes that get less direct sun.</p>

      <p>Light algae staining can sometimes be cleaned. But thick moss growth that has worked its way under shingle edges has already caused damage that cleaning alone won&rsquo;t fix.</p>

      <h2>8. Rising Energy Bills</h2>

      <p>A failing roof often loses its ability to insulate effectively. If your energy bills have been climbing steadily and your HVAC system checks out fine, the roof may be the culprit. Damaged or missing roofing materials allow conditioned air to escape and outdoor heat to penetrate, forcing your cooling system to work harder &mdash; a particular problem during LA&rsquo;s long, hot summers.</p>

      <p>Modern roofing materials, including cool-rated shingles, reflective metal panels, and <a href="../tesla-solar.html">Tesla Solar Roof tiles</a>, can significantly improve your home&rsquo;s energy performance while providing reliable protection.</p>

      <h2>9. Flashing Damage Around Penetrations</h2>

      <p>Flashing is the metal or sealant material installed around chimneys, vents, skylights, and where the roof meets walls. It&rsquo;s one of the most common leak sources on any roof. Over time, flashing can crack, pull away, or corrode &mdash; especially older tar-based flashing that becomes brittle with age and UV exposure.</p>

      <p>Damaged flashing can sometimes be repaired independently. But on an older roof, failing flashing is often a symptom of broader material breakdown. If flashing is failing in multiple locations, it usually makes more sense to address everything at once with a complete re-roof.</p>

      <h2>What to Do Next</h2>

      <p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed one or more of these warning signs, the most important step is a professional roof inspection. Many problems that seem minor from the ground are more serious up close, and some issues that look alarming turn out to be simple, affordable repairs.</p>
