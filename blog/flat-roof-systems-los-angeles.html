      <span class="blog-date" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 2rem;">February 18, 2026</span>

      <p>Many homes across Los Angeles use flat or low-slope roofing systems &mdash; especially modern builds, mid-century designs, and properties with rooftop decks in neighborhoods like <a href="../areas/malibu.html">Malibu</a>, <a href="../areas/venice.html">Venice</a>, and <a href="../areas/studio-city.html">Studio City</a>. Despite the name, <a href="../residential.html">flat roofs</a> aren&rsquo;t perfectly flat. They have a slight slope for water drainage, but they require completely different materials and installation techniques than a traditional pitched roof.</p>

      <p>If your home has a flat roof or you&rsquo;re considering one for a new build, understanding the three most common membrane systems &mdash; TPO, PVC, and torch down &mdash; will help you make the right decision for your property and your budget.</p>

      <h2>What is TPO Roofing?</h2>

      <p>TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is one of the most widely installed flat roofing materials in Los Angeles. It&rsquo;s a single-ply white membrane that reflects sunlight, helping reduce cooling costs during California&rsquo;s hot summers.</p>

      <p>TPO seams are heat-welded &mdash; fused together with hot air rather than adhesive. This creates a watertight bond that holds up over time. It&rsquo;s lightweight, energy-efficient, and typically the most affordable single-ply flat roof option.</p>

      <p>TPO flat roofs generally last 15 to 20 years with proper installation and maintenance.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> homeowners looking for solid flat roof performance at a reasonable price, especially on larger roof areas.</p>

      <h2>What is PVC Roofing?</h2>

      <p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) has been used on flat roofs for decades and has one of the longest track records of any single-ply membrane. Like TPO, PVC seams are heat-welded for a strong, permanent bond.</p>

      <p>Where PVC stands apart is chemical and fire resistance. If your roof is near kitchen exhaust vents, HVAC equipment, or anything producing grease or chemical exposure, PVC handles it better than other options. It also carries excellent fire ratings &mdash; an important factor for homes in LA&rsquo;s fire-prone hillside and canyon neighborhoods like <a href="../areas/pacific-palisades.html">Pacific Palisades</a>, <a href="../areas/calabasas.html">Calabasas</a>, and <a href="../areas/hollywood-hills.html">Hollywood Hills</a>.</p>

      <p>PVC roofing costs more than TPO but delivers added durability in demanding conditions. Expect 20 to 30 years of lifespan with proper care.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> properties with rooftop equipment, homes in fire zones, or homeowners who want maximum longevity from a <a href="../residential.html">flat roof system</a>.</p>

      <h2>What is Torch Down Roofing?</h2>

      <p>Torch down (modified bitumen) is the traditional flat roofing method that has been used reliably for decades. It&rsquo;s a modified asphalt membrane applied using an open flame to melt and bond the material to the roof surface, creating a thick, durable, multi-layered system.</p>

      <p>Torch down handles foot traffic better than TPO or PVC, making it a strong choice if you regularly access your roof for maintenance or have a rooftop deck. It also performs well in areas where water tends to pool.</p>

      <p>The tradeoff is the installation process &mdash; the open flame requires experienced, safety-conscious crews. Torch down is also darker in color, meaning it absorbs more heat than white reflective membranes.</p>

      <p>A well-installed torch down roof typically lasts 15 to 20 years.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> roofs with regular foot traffic, rooftop decks, or homeowners who prefer a proven traditional system.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does a Flat Roof Cost in Los Angeles?</h2>

      <p>Flat roof costs in Los Angeles vary based on the material, roof size, accessibility, and whether it&rsquo;s a new installation or replacement. As a general range:</p>

      <p>TPO is typically the most budget-friendly single-ply option. PVC runs moderate to higher cost, reflecting its superior durability. Torch down is mid-range, varying with the number of layers.</p>

      <p>Every property is different, so the best way to get an accurate number is a free on-site evaluation. WesTec Roofing provides detailed, transparent estimates with no hidden fees. <a href="../contact.html">Request your free estimate</a>.</p>

      <h2>Which Flat Roof Material is Right for Your Home?</h2>

      <p>A quick comparison:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tightest budget, good performance:</strong> TPO</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum durability and chemical resistance:</strong> PVC</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy foot traffic or rooftop deck:</strong> Torch down</li>
        <li><strong>Best energy efficiency:</strong> TPO or PVC (white reflective surface)</li>
        <li><strong>Fire zone property:</strong> PVC (highest fire resistance)</li>
        <li><strong>Longest lifespan:</strong> PVC</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The most important factor isn&rsquo;t which material you pick &mdash; it&rsquo;s the quality of the installation. A properly installed TPO roof will outlast a poorly installed PVC roof every time. That&rsquo;s why working with an experienced Los Angeles roofing contractor matters more than choosing any single product.</p>
