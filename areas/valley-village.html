  <!-- Main Content -->
  <section style="padding: 5rem 3rem; max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Valley Village is a tight-knit residential community tucked between Studio City, North Hollywood, and the Los Angeles River channel. Its compact blocks of post-war homes and multi-family buildings carry roofing systems that range from original 1940s construction to recent renovations. WesTec Roofing works extensively in Valley Village, bringing practical knowledge of this neighborhood's building stock and the specific roofing challenges that come with maintaining older structures under San Fernando Valley conditions.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Architecture &amp; Roofing in Valley Village</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Valley Village developed rapidly in the years following World War II, producing blocks of charming bungalows and single-story ranch homes built between the late 1940s and early 1950s. Composition shingle is the predominant roofing material on these single-family residences, typically on moderate gable or hip roof configurations. The neighborhood also includes a significant number of duplexes, fourplexes, and mid-century apartment buildings, many of which feature flat or very low-slope roofs with built-up or modified bitumen systems. As the area has seen renewed investment in recent years, some property owners have upgraded to modern materials, but a large share of roofs in Valley Village still reflect the original construction era.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Common Roofing Challenges in Valley Village</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The most pressing concern for Valley Village property owners is aging roof infrastructure. Many homes still carry roofing systems that are original to the 1940s or 1950s, and even those that have been re-roofed once may be reaching the end of their second lifecycle. Flat roofs on multi-unit buildings present their own set of issues, including ponding water from inadequate drainage slopes, deteriorating membrane seams, and parapet wall flashing failures that allow water intrusion into living spaces below. Valley heat compounds every problem, accelerating material breakdown across all roof types and causing the asphalt in shingles and built-up roofing to dry out and become brittle. Older structures may also need deck reinforcement or code-compliant upgrades when re-roofing, particularly if the original sheathing has suffered water damage over the decades.</p>
