  <!-- Main Content -->
  <section style="padding: 5rem 3rem; max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Nestled between the Los Angeles River and Griffith Park, Atwater Village has quietly become one of the eastside's most sought-after neighborhoods while retaining its small-town feel. WesTec Roofing provides Atwater Village homeowners with roofing services that respect the neighborhood's Craftsman heritage and meet the practical needs of its evolving housing stock.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Architecture &amp; Roofing in Atwater Village</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The residential fabric of Atwater Village is rooted in the 1920s and 1930s building boom that produced the Craftsman bungalows and Spanish Revival cottages lining streets like Edenhurst Avenue and Glenfeliz Boulevard. These homes typically carry composition shingle roofs on the Craftsman side and original clay tile on the Spanish Revival structures. Post-war duplexes and small apartment buildings introduced flat and low-slope roof profiles to the neighborhood. More recently, contemporary infill projects along Glendale Boulevard have brought modern materials like standing seam metal and single-ply membranes. The result is a compact neighborhood where you can find four distinct roofing systems within a two-block walk.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Common Roofing Challenges in Atwater Village</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Many of Atwater Village's original bungalows are approaching or have passed the century mark, and their roofs reflect that age. Deteriorating original materials, including brittle composition shingles and cracked clay tiles, are common across the neighborhood. Low-slope Craftsman roofs with shallow pitches are particularly prone to drainage problems, especially when original gutters have corroded or been improperly modified over the decades. A number of older homes still have knob-and-tube wiring running through their attic spaces, which must be carefully addressed before any re-roofing work can proceed. Homeowners also face the challenge of upgrading their roofs with modern, high-performance materials while preserving the Craftsman aesthetic that gives the neighborhood its identity.</p>
