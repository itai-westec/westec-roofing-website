    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">WesTec Roofing provides dependable roofing services throughout Redondo Beach, where a large portion of the housing stock is reaching the age when roof replacement becomes a necessity rather than a choice. Many of Redondo Beach's post-war homes are carrying original or second-generation roofs that have reached the end of their useful life. Our team specializes in upgrading these aging systems with modern, weather-resistant materials that protect homes for decades to come while respecting the character of this established South Bay community.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Architecture &amp; Roofing in Redondo Beach</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Redondo Beach has two distinct architectural identities. North Redondo, further from the coast, is characterized by suburban ranch homes built in the 1950s and 1960s, many featuring low-pitched roofs with composition shingles or original built-up flat roof systems. South Redondo, closer to the harbor and beach, has seen significant redevelopment with newer coastal contemporary townhomes, modern three-story builds, and renovated beach bungalows. These newer properties often feature flat roofs, standing seam metal accents, and rooftop decks. The original beach bungalows that dot streets near the Esplanade retain their mid-century charm, typically with simple gable roofs designed for an era before modern waterproofing standards.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: var(--serif); color: var(--primary); margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">Common Roofing Challenges in Redondo Beach</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-light); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Salt air corrosion is an ongoing challenge for every metal component on Redondo Beach roofs, from flashing and drip edges to gutter hardware and vent boots. Coastal moisture and fog accelerate the breakdown of underlayment and decking materials, particularly on older homes where original felt paper has long since lost its waterproofing ability. Flat roofs on ranch-style homes and older bungalows are prone to ponding water, a condition that worsens as roof decking sags over time and drainage pathways become blocked. Perhaps the most common issue we encounter in Redondo Beach is simply age. Many post-war composition shingle roofs have exceeded their 25-to-30-year lifespan and are showing signs of curling, granule loss, and cracked sealant strips, leaving the home vulnerable to leaks during winter rainstorms.</p>
